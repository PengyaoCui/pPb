\label{sec:Results}

\subsection{\pt yields}

\begin{itemize}
	\item yields in JC, OC, PC, NJ in minimum bias (+ inclusive - from the published paper)
	\item yields in JC, OC, PC, NJ in ``centrality'' bins
	\item ratio of the ``centrality'' bins to minimum bias \ask{NEW FIGURE! + discussion}
\end{itemize}

\ask{all above for V0 and ZNA - better into an appendix... (?); show the ``density'' plots?}

\subsection{L/K ratios}

\begin{itemize}
	\item ratios in JC, OC, PC, NJ in minimum bias (+ inclusive from the published paper)
	\item ratios in JC, OC, PC, NJ in ``centrality'' bins
	\item ratio of the ``centrality'' bins to minimum bias \ask{NEW FIGURE! + discussion}
\end{itemize}

\ask{all above for V0 and ZNA}

\subsection{\Vzero\ as a function of $R$}

\subsection{mean \pt}

\ask{the mean \pt\ needs to be discussed; however, we may want to see the ratios}
