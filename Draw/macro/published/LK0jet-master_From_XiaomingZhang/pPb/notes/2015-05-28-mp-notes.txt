1. Results presentation to be finished
- final high-resolution figures of the spectra
- add the ratio of central/min bias (?)
- the mean pT needs a discussion
- decide: what in the main body and what into an appendix

2. Conclusions (should be easy)

3. Details on systematic uncertainties
- additional figure with relative contributions separated (in function of pT and for different centrality classes)

4. Additional considerations
- Shorten the introduction ?
- More details on the L,K reconstruction? Jet reconstruction?
