I have spotted couple of small things which would be good to correct before we send the draft to the IRC. I believe that it should be quick to fix them, so here they are (listed in the order of appearance):

l. 71: describbed -> described
l. 100: cm should not be italic in the first case on this line,
  vz < 10 cm -> |vz| < 10cm
l. 119: was be compensated -> was compensated
l. 143: mismatch in font for "rad"
l. 152: fill gas -> gas

Section 2.3: add there a description about how the lambda and K0S sample is clean after the topological selection?

Section 2.5 title: Corrections for V0 reconstruction ... -> Corrections for finite V0 reconstruction ...

l. 210-211:
shall we perhaps be more specific and say that the ratio for R<0.4 to inclusive decreases from 20% at lower pT and approaches  10% at higher pT?

l. 214: where -> were

 maybe reformulate a bit to read: were in addition also corrected for ....

l. 223-226: There seems to be still a mismatch between the values in the text, table and Fig. 2:

 table quotes track selection 4%, while in the text is 5% and from the figure it looks more like ~2%

 fig. 2 quotes "competing V0", while it is not mentioned in the table, nor in the text explicitly, material budget is in the table and text, but not in Fig.2 so we should make it clear in the text that e.g. the material budget is overall 5% and thus not shown in Fig.2 etc.

l. 243 were -> was
l. 246 reformulate to read: For jets with pT...> 10 GeV/c at low momentat (pT...) it reaches up to 10% while it is about 20% for jets with pT ...> 20

l. 248 almost a constant 5%  -> almost constant at 5% (?)

l. 275 inermediate -> intermediate
l. 291 pT -> "T" should be subscripted
l. 301 enahncement -> enhancement
l. 330 constitent -> consistent

Following things can be done later:

Figures:
in general I suggest to use besides different colours different symbols (at the moment only circles are used) for b/w printout.

There is a mixed usage of past tense - has been vs was and I think it would be good to stick to one and use it consistently (as the figures, not needed right now, but we should keep it in mind for future iterations).

 THanks again, Mateusz for the great work on the text.

          With best regards, Jana

P.S. I will be offline on Wed and Thu as we have public holidays and will have only limited access to internet so I apologize if I do not react promptly.
