PC meeting on 29 of May 2015
----------------------------

On the text:
- main body of the text will contain only the min bias results (0-100% - no centrality selection) - the centrality selections go into appendix (text will remark on no centrality dependence in jets and refer to the appendix)
- the above depends somewhat on the <pT> results - decided to think about at a later time
- final high resolution figures are being prepared by X
- in general: agreement is to keep things short (modulo tech plots of efficiencies and uncertainty estimations) as the analyses has been already established by other papers

<pT> results:
- X will prepare a summary for the PC on the extraction of the <pT>; fits and uncertainties
- these results are to be discussed in the PWG-JE and potentially in the PWG-LF groups
- this will be added (committed to git) as a part of the analysis note

L/antiL ratio:
- X will resend the results from this analysis to PC
- PWG-LF will be contacted with those results (to be put into the twiki https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/ALICE/LambdabarOverLambda)

Proceedings:
- next meeting tentatively on Friday (5th of June) next week - this to be decided on Wednesday (M will query via email)
- the expectation is that the next version of the draft will be available by Thursday-noon
- comments/suggestions/other things - email (hopefully via the e-group)

Other:
- the e-group still blocks emails from Jana -> M and X will check offline
- X will verify whether git allows the push (things to be added anyhow)
