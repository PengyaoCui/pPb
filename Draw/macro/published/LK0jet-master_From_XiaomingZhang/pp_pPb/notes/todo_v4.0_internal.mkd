# TODO for tag version-4.0-internal


## Reminder

- There is no approved results in pp for Fig 7 since the systematic is not complemented

- PYTHIA simulations are added in Fig 8
  - With the same conditions in data (energy, jet radius, match radius)
  - The shift between lab frame and cms frame in p-Pb is also considered


# Todo
- Compare with PYTHIA New QCD-CR
  - The MPI-CR is used in current simulations

- Check the text
