  A suggestion to the abstract: maybe we should add a sentence on the motivation of our measurement at the beginning of the abstract. What do you think?


  Section 1:
  it reads very nicely and coherenly, just small suggestions/corrections:

x  l. 22 - introduce abbreviation for the LHC and sqrt(s_NN) ?
x  l. 32, 34 ... pA -> p-A (to be in line with our p-Pb notation?), similarly AA -> A-A

x  l. 34 introduce RHIC (?)
x  l. 41 falsyfying -> falsifying
x  l. 50-51 if we define sqrt(sNN) above we do not need to spell out center-of-mass ... here


 x l. 53 intermediate pT: we should be specific here and mention explicitly 2-5 GeV/c region or so.
 x l. 55 velovity -> velocity


x  l. 62: of Lambda and antilambdaand K0S, where the production of particles is studied ... -> of Lambda, antilambda and K0S, where their production is studied ...
x  l. 65 10or20GeV/c -> spaces missing, move "or" out of math mode

x    reconstructed with the anti-kT ... -> reconstructed from charged particles with the anti-kT ...

x  l. 66  R of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 -> R=0.2, 0.3 and 0.4.

x  l. 66  The Lambda-to-K0S -> The Lambda/K0S

   Section 2:
x  Title of Section 2.1 currently reads "Data sample" but it is more on detectors, maybe change it to: "Data sample and detector description" or something like this?

-x  l. 70 by ALICE detector -> by the ALICE experiment (?)

x  l. 71 Since the 2-in-1 -> sounds a bit like slang, maybe put it in the "" and spell out as it is also in Ref. 36: Because of its “two-in-one” magnet design ...
or in that reference they also use "twin-bore" (but the first one sounds more familiar and easier to grasp for a general reader).

x  l. 72 the energy .. are not independent and their ratio -> the energies ... are not independent and their ratio ...

x   l. 73-74 Consequently, ... was moving ... -> Consequently, .... was shifted  by a rapidity ... T
x   l. 75 The used data -> The analyzed data (?)

x   l. 79 remove one of the eta

x   l. 86 ITS -> The ITS

x   l. 91 - 97: a veeery long sentence. I would cut it after (d0). and start a new sentence: This impact parameter, which corresponds to the distance of closest approach of the track to the primary vertes in the plane transvers to the beam direction, has a resolution better than ....

x   l. 107: in these analyses -> in this analysis

x   The V0 text h around l. 108 and following as well as Section 2.2 (l.116). We should stick to the proper notation for VZERO vs. V0 (I admit I never remember which one is it though ;-) ).


x   l. 116 and 117: no need to repeat the pseudorapidity coverage of VZEROA and C, it is mentioned on l. 111 and l.112. Alternatively we can move the VZERO related text in sec. 2.1 to the event selection section 2.2. Moreover similarly ZDC location info is repetitive in lines 112-114 and l. 124 and ff and thus could be also compactified and only mentioned i n Sec. 2.2, I think.

x  l. 127 10cm -> insert a space and make cm non-italic
x  l. 130-131. ... selected by the trigger and the total number ... -> ...selected by the trigger. The total number ...

  Section 2.3 and 2.5 -> Combine them to one called "Charged particle and strange particle identification" ? Or at minimum I would swap the order of Section 2.5 and Section 2.4 because if we wnat to add around l. 160 the note on the consequence of labda/k0s not contributing to the energy of jet, it would be more logical order of sections.

x  l. 146 moved -> is shifted

-x-  Section 2.4 on Jet reconstruction: I think we should  briefly mention following (this is a cut and past from the p-Pb jet paper):
...
    The azimuthal distribution of these high quality tracks is not completely uniform due to inefficient regions in the SPD. This can be compensated by considering in addition tracks
without reconstructed track points in the SPD. For those tracks, the primary vertex is used as an additional constraint in the track fitting to improve the momentum resolution. This approach yields a very uniform tracking efficiency within the acceptance, which is needed to avoid geometrical biases of the jet reconstruction algorithm caused by a non-uniform
density of reconstructed tracks. The procedure is described in detail in the context of jet reconstruction with ALICE in Pb–Pb events [12]. For the analyzed data, the additional tracks (without SPD track points) constitute approximately 4.3% of the used track sample.
...

  which we can compactify a bit  to something like this and  change the text around l. 156 and ff.:
...
Charged particle tracks were reconstructed as tracks in the ITS and the TPC which cover the full azimuth and $|\eta_{lab}|<$~0.9. To assure uniform azimuthal distribution of charged tracks, the track sample consisting of tracks containing information from the two inner SPD layers of the ITS with the best momentum resolution but suffering from SPD azimuthal inefficiencies was extended by adding tracks without signal in the SPD but with the primary vertex included in the track fitting to improve their momentum resolution. This approach results in a uniform azimuthal tracking efficiency and minimizes geometrical biases on jet acceptance.
...
 (please feel free to smooth it ;-) )

x l. 166, if we change the ordering of sections then there is no need to mention "see section ..." ).

x l. 175-177 replace "x rad^-1" with ". rad^-1" (?)

-x l. 178 - 179: Yes, I agree that we should comment on jets with pt>10 GeV/c. Xiaoming, please can you redo Fig. 1 of ref[24] with this jet pt selection? Mateusz do you also mean to add here a similar info which Ruediger has inferred from Fig. 2 and the text on page 6?


  Section 2.5

x l. 181: The reconstruction the V0particles (K0S Lambda, and antilambda) is follows -> The reconstruction of the V0 particles (Lambda, antilambda, and K0S) follows ...

x l. 183: My view: I would keep the details on V0 reconstruction at the minimum level. If the topological cuts are the same, I would even skip Table 1 and refer to the one in ref [20] and really mention only basic facts such as the decay channel and its B.R. used unless we differ somewhere from [20].


  Section 2.6

x  l. 205: In this analysis that the selection cuts for primary particle tracks used for the jet reconstruction are not compatible with the V0 candidate tracks -> In this analysis the selection criteria for primary charged particle tracks used for the jet reconstruction are different from those of the V0 candidate daughter tracks.

x  l. 211: 10$GeV/c$: 10~GeV/$c$, in those -> in these
x  l. 212: particles asssociated a jet -> particles associated with a jet

x eq(1) move the definition to l. 209-210 where it is first mentioned?

-x  A general comment: although the bullet style is nice and clearly explaining the yield extraction (l. 214-225), I think we should use a regular text in the paper. The same I think is true for lines 227-233.

x  l. 235: move the "," to Eq.(2)

 Section 2.8
x l. 242: The efficiencies of V0particles -> The reconstruction efficiencies of V0 particles
-x l. 249 within events conaining-> for events containing
  mention how much the eff. varies with R?

x  l. 256 is of about -> is about
x  l. 257 Lambdayields -> Lambda yields



x    A general comment after I read upto here, I think we have too many subsections. Would it make sense to combine 2.6 and 2.7 to one subsection "Matching of V0 particles to jets and underlying event" and combine 2.8 and 2.9 which are really short to "Corrections for V0 reconstruction and feed-down". What do you think?

  Section 2.10 Systematic uncertainties

x   I suggest to move l. 261-262 after the text on line 267 and modify them to read "The systematic uncertainties on the strange particle spectra ... ".

x   l. 271 by a physical jet -> from a physical jet
x   l. 273 from true high-pTjet -> from a true high-p_T jet

-x   again I would "de-buletize" the text here/

x   l. 276: remove "the so called"
x   l. 280 add a space after "6"
x   l. 288 and caption of FIg. 3: add a space after 10 and 20, resp.
x   l. 289 For the pTch,jet and largely independent -> For pTch,jet ... and is largely independent

x   l. 290 contribution 14% from the uncertainty-> contribution of 14% originating from the uncertainty

   Figure 1: caption
x    Efficiency of V0 particles -> Efficiency of V0 particles in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=~5.02 TeV

x    inclusice -> inclusive

x    within ... -> within $\Delta R_{V^0-jet}$ < 0.4 and $\Delta R_{V^0-jet}$ > 0.6

x*    btw we should stick to the same nomenclature in the text and Fig. labels.

x   Figure 2: remove ")" after K0S



-x   We should improve the legibility of the figure 1 and 2, currently too small fonts


     I will send rest of my comments on Section 3 and 4 later today, OK? I have to run.


     Cheers, Jana

     ---

      here comes the rest of my comments (btw Vit, unfortunately on my computer at home your commented PDF does not show the comments - I see only yellow fields without the commented text).

-x  Before coming to comments on Section 3 and 4 before which I had to stop in the afternoon, let me still come back to Section 2.10 on systematic uncertainties which I inspected closer on my way back home once more. It appears that the description of various systematic uncertainties in the text, Table 2 and Figure 2 is not consistent. E.g. in Fig. 2 are quoted "topological" selections and "Competing V0", none of them is in Table 2, the latter neither in the text. Btw. what kind of systematics is meant by the "competing V0", is it the Lambda vs K0S cross-contamination? Regarding feed-down, it is in the text, Table 2, but not in Fig.2 middle and right plots. We should also plot all three panels in Fig.2 with the same range on the y-axis, as at first glance without looking at numbers carefully one could thing that the situation is much worser for K0S while contrary is true.

-x  In Fig.3 the jet pt uncertainty goes up to about 20% for 20 GeV jet selection at low V0 pT, but the text says up to 10% (this is true for 10 GeV jets)

-x  Fig. 3 legend Underlying subtraction -> Underlying event subtraction
  Or UE subtraction

-x  We should also note how are the systematic uncertainties propagated to the lambda/K0S ratio.


  Continuation of comments:
