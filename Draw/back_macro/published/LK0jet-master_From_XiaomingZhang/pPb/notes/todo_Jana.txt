-x  l. 70 by ALICE detector -> by the ALICE experiment (?)

-x-  Section 2.4 on Jet reconstruction: I think we should  briefly mention following (this is a cut and past from the p-Pb jet paper):
...
    The azimuthal distribution of these high quality tracks is not completely uniform due to inefficient regions in the SPD. This can be compensated by considering in addition tracks
without reconstructed track points in the SPD. For those tracks, the primary vertex is used as an additional constraint in the track fitting to improve the momentum resolution. This approach yields a very uniform tracking efficiency within the acceptance, which is needed to avoid geometrical biases of the jet reconstruction algorithm caused by a non-uniform
density of reconstructed tracks. The procedure is described in detail in the context of jet reconstruction with ALICE in Pbâ€“Pb events [12]. For the analyzed data, the additional tracks (without SPD track points) constitute approximately 4.3% of the used track sample.
...

  which we can compactify a bit  to something like this and  change the text around l. 156 and ff.:
...
Charged particle tracks were reconstructed as tracks in the ITS and the TPC which cover the full azimuth and $|\eta_{lab}|<$~0.9. To assure uniform azimuthal distribution of charged tracks, the track sample consisting of tracks containing information from the two inner SPD layers of the ITS with the best momentum resolution but suffering from SPD azimuthal inefficiencies was extended by adding tracks without signal in the SPD but with the primary vertex included in the track fitting to improve their momentum resolution. This approach results in a uniform azimuthal tracking efficiency and minimizes geometrical biases on jet acceptance.

 (please feel free to smooth it ;-) )

-x l. 178 - 179: Yes, I agree that we should comment on jets with pt>10 GeV/c. Xiaoming, please can you redo Fig. 1 of ref[24] with this jet pt selection? Mateusz do you also mean to add here a similar info which Ruediger has inferred from Fig. 2 and the text on page 6?

-x  A general comment: although the bullet style is nice and clearly explaining the yield extraction (l. 214-225), I think we should use a regular text in the paper. The same I think is true for lines 227-233.

-x l. 249 within events conaining-> for events containing
  mention how much the eff. varies with R?

-x   again I would "de-buletize" the text here/

-x   We should improve the legibility of the figure 1 and 2, currently too small fonts

-x  Before coming to comments on Section 3 and 4 before which I had to stop in the afternoon, let me still come back to Section 2.10 on systematic uncertainties which I inspected closer on my way back home once more. It appears that the description of various systematic uncertainties in the text, Table 2 and Figure 2 is not consistent. E.g. in Fig. 2 are quoted "topological" selections and "Competing V0", none of them is in Table 2, the latter neither in the text. Btw. what kind of systematics is meant by the "competing V0", is it the Lambda vs K0S cross-contamination? Regarding feed-down, it is in the text, Table 2, but not in Fig.2 middle and right plots. We should also plot all three panels in Fig.2 with the same range on the y-axis, as at first glance without looking at numbers carefully one could thing that the situation is much worser for K0S while contrary is true.

-x  In Fig.3 the jet pt uncertainty goes up to about 20% for 20 GeV jet selection at low V0 pT, but the text says up to 10% (this is true for 10 GeV jets)

-x  Fig. 3 legend Underlying subtraction -> Underlying event subtraction
  Or UE subtraction

-x  We should also note how are the systematic uncertainties propagated to the lambda/K0S ratio.

-x Fig. 4: do we want to perhaps add here also ptjet>20 GeV/c V0 spectra?

-x l. 307 I think we always take the average of L+antiL which is divided by K0S
