The production of \lda\ baryons and \ks\ mesons has been measured separately in hard scattering region and the underlying event in \pPb\ collisions at \sqrtsnn{5.02} at the LHC.
The hard scatterings are selected on an event-by-event basis by jets reconstructed using charged particles with \akT\ jet finder and resolution parameter $R=0.4$ (or $R=0.2$), and \ptjet\ of $10$ (or $20$)~\gevc.

The ratio of inclusive differential yields of \lda\ and \ks\ at intermediate transverse momentum (\pt) is much larger in the systems such as \PbPb\ and \pPb\ collisions as compared to \pp\ collisions. The increased ratio in \PbPb\ has been attributed to collective effects in those collisions. Recent studies have revealed qualitatively similar effects in high-multiplicity \pPb\ collisions.

In this letter, we report that in \pPb\ collisions the ratio of \lda\ to \ks\ associated to jets is consistent with \pp\ expectation given by PYTHIA event generator. Whereas, the ratio in the underlying event shows a prominent maximum (similar to the inclusive distribution) at the intermediate \pt\ of 2-5 \gevc. Moreover the yields in jets do not change with the event multiplicity, while the large baryon/meson ratio evolves and it is larger in events with the highest multiplicity as compared to minimum bias collisions.
