\section{Data analysis}

\subsection{Data sample}

The data used for this analysis was recorded by ALICE detector~\cite{Aamodt:2008zz} during the LHC p--Pb run at \sqrtsnn{5.02} in the beginning of $2013$. Since the $2$-in-$1$ magnet design of the LHC~\cite{Evans:2008zzb}, the energy of the two beams are not independent and their ratio is fixed to equal to the ratio of the charge/mass ratios of each beam. Consequently, the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass system (cms) was moving with a rapidity of $\Delta y_{\rm NN}=0.465$ in the direction of the proton beam. The used data was collected for the beam configuration, in which the Pb beam circulated in the ``counter-clockwise'' direction traveling from negative to positive rapidity.
%%The number of colliding bunches was varied from $8$ to $288$. The total number of proton and Pb ion bunch intensities ranged from $0.2\times 10^{12}$ to $6.5\times 10^{12}$ and from $0.1\times 10^{12}$ to $4.4\times 10^{12}$, respectively.
%%The luminosity at the ALICE interaction point for the data used in this analysis was up to $5\times 10^{27}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ resulting a $10$~kHZ hadronic interaction rate. The r.m.s of the interaction region is $6.3$~cm along the beam direction and $60~\mu{\rm m}$ in the direction to the transverse to the beam. The used data was collected for the beam configuration, in which the Pb beam circulated in the ``counter-clockwise'' direction, corresponding to travel from ALICE C to A side or positive rapidity.

The ALICE apparatus~\cite{Aamodt:2008zz} consists of central barrel detectors covering the pseudo-rapidity interval $|\eta|<0.9$, a forward muon spectrometer covering the pseudo-rapidity interval $-4.0<\hlab{\eta}<-2.5$, and a set of detectors at forward and backward rapidities used for triggering and event characterization. 

Tracking and particle identification are performed using the information provided by the Inner Tracking System (ITS) \cite{Aamodt:2010aa}, the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) \cite{Alme:2010ke} and the Time Of Flight (TOF) \cite{Akindinov:2013tea} detectors, that have full azimuthal coverage in the pseudo-rapidity interval $|\hlab|<0.9$. 
These central barrel detectors are located inside a large solenoidal magnet, which provides a magnetic field of 0.5 T along the beam direction ($z$ axis in the ALICE reference frame). 

%%The detector closest to the beam axis is the Inner Tracking System (ITS). 
ITS is composed of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors, with radial distances from the beam axis ranging from 3.9~cm to 43.0~cm. 
The two innermost layers, with average radii of 3.9~cm and 7.6~cm, are equipped with Silicon Pixel Detectors (SPD). 
The two SPD layers, covering the pseudo-rapidity ranges of $|\hlab|< 2.0$ and $|\hlab|< 1.4$ respectively, have 1200 SPD readout chips.  
The two intermediate layers are made of Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD), while Silicon Strip Detectors (SSD) equip the two outermost layers. 
The high spatial resolution of the silicon sensors, together with the low material budget (on average 7.7\% of a radiation length for tracks crossing the ITS perpendicularly to the detector surfaces, i.e.\ $\hlab=0$) and the small distance of the innermost layer from the beam vacuum tube, allow for the measurement of the track impact parameter in the transverse plane ($d_0$), i.e.\ the distance of closest approach of the track to the primary vertex in the plane transverse to the beam direction, with a resolution better than 75~$\mu$m for transverse momenta $\pt>1~\gevc$~\cite{Aamodt:2010aa}.
The SPD provides also a measurement of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision based on track segments (tracklets) built by associating pairs of hits in the two SPD layers.

At larger radii ($85<r<247~\cm$), a 510 cm long cylindrical TPC provides track reconstruction with up to 159 three-dimensional space points per track, as well as particle identification via the measurement of the specific energy deposit $\dedx$ in the gas.
The charged particle identification capability of the TPC is supplemented by the TOF, which is equipped with Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers  (MRPCs) located at radial distances between 377 and 399 cm from the beam axis. The overall TOF resolution including the uncertainty on the time at which the collision took place, and the tracking and momentum resolution was about 160~ps for the data-taking period considered in these analyses. 

The V0 detector~\cite{Abbas:2013taa}, used for triggering and for estimating the multiplicity of charged particles in the forward rapidity region, consists of two arrays of 32 scintillator tiles each, placed around the beam vacuum tube on either side of the interaction region at $z =-90$ cm and $z=+340$ cm. The two arrays cover the pseudo-rapidity intervals $-3.7 < \hlab < -1.7$ (VZERO-C) and $2.8 < \hlab < 5.1$ (VZERO-A), respectively. In addition two Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) located at $+112.5$ m (\ZNA) and $-112.5$ m (\ZNC) from the interaction point were used for beam background rejection and an alternative estimator of the event activity.

%%Only events with interaction vertex reconstructed from tracks with a coordinate $|z|<10$~cm along the beam line were used for the analysis.

%%\ask{this and the next section are fixed in the next version}

\subsection{Event selection}

The minimum-bias trigger signal was provided by the VZERO~\cite{Abbas:2013taa} counters, the VZERO-A in Pb beam direction and the VZERO-C in proton beam direction covering the pseudo-rapidity $2.8<\hlab<5.1$ and $-3.7<\hlab<-1.7$, respectively.
The signal amplitude and arrival time collected in each tile of the detectors were recorded. 
A coincidence of signals in both VZERO-A and VZERO-C detectors was required to remove contamination from single diffractive and electromagnetic events~\cite{ALICE:2012xs}. 
The resolution of the arrival time is better than $1$~ns, allowing discrimination of beam--beam collisions from background events produced outside of the interaction region.
In the offline analysis, background was further suppressed by the time information recorded in two neutron Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs), which located at $+112.5$~m (ZNA) and $-112.5$~m (ZNC) from the interaction point.
A dedicated quartz radiator Cherenkov detector (T0)~\cite{Akindinov:2013tea} provided a measurement of the event time of the collision.

%%In order to reduce the underlying background of jets and improve the resolution of the $\Vzero$ decay vertices, the pileup and bad quality events are rejected by the vertex quality cuts. 
%%In addition to the trigger selection, timing and vertex-quality cuts were used to suppress pile-up events and retain only beam-beam collisions. 

The events were further selected by requiring a reconstructed vertex within $10cm$ ($v_{z}<10$~cm) along beam axis and that the vertices built from SPD tracklets and from the global tracks (combining information of ITS and TPC) were compatible. 
The analysis requires a reconstructed vertex, which is the case for 98.2\% of the events selected by the trigger and the total number of events retained in the analysis was 96~M.

\subsection{Charged particle reconstruction}

Charged-hadron identification in the central barrel was performed with the ITS, TPC and TOF detectors. The drift and strip layers of the ITS provide a measurement of the specific energy loss with a resolution of about 10\%. In a standalone tracking mode, the identification of pions, kaons, and protons is thus extended down to respectively 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 \gevc\ in \pt. The TPC provides particle identification at low momenta via specific energy loss \dedx\ in the fill gas by measuring up to 159 samples per track with a resolution of about 6\%. The separation power achieved in \pPb\ collisions is identical to that in pp collisions~\cite{Abelev:2014ffa}. Further outwards at about 3.7 m from the beam line, the TOF array allows identification at higher \pt\ measuring the particle speed with the time-of-flight technique. The total time resolution is about 85 ps for events in the multiplicity classes from 0\% to $\sim 80$\%.  In more peripheral collisions, where multiplicities are similar to pp, it decreases to about 120 ps due to a worse start-time (collision-time) resolution~\cite{Abelev:2014ffa}. The start-time of the event was determined by combining the time estimated using the particle arrival times at the TOF and the time measured by the T0 detector.

Since the \pPb\ center-of-mass system moved in the laboratory frame with a rapidity of \ynn\ = $-0.465$, the nominal acceptance of the central barrel of the ALICE detector was asymmetric with respect to \ycms\ = 0.  In order to ensure good detector acceptance and optimal particle identification performance, tracks were selected in the rapidity interval $0 < \ycms < 0.5$ in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass system. Event generator studies and repeating the analysis in $\left|\ycms\right| < 0.2$ indicate differences between the two rapidity selections smaller than 2\% in the normalization and 3\% in the shape of the transverse momentum distributions.

\subsection{Jet reconstruction}

The spectrum of jets reconstructed with charged particles in \pPb\ collisions at \sqrtsnn{5.02} within ALICE was reported in \cite{Adam:2015hoa}.
The jet reconstruction in this letter follows the analysis presented in \cite{Adam:2015hoa} therefore here only a brief review of the most relevant points is presented.
Charged particles are reconstructed as tracks in the ITS and the TPC which cover the full azimuth and $|\eta_\mathrm{lab}| < 0.9$. 
Tracks with $\pt > 0.15 \mathrm{~GeV}/c$ and within a pseudorapidity interval $|\eta_\mathrm{lab}|<0.9$ were used as input to the jet reconstruction.
The overall efficiency for charged particle detection, including the effect of tracking efficiency as well as the geometrical acceptance, is 70\% at $\pt = 0.15 \mbox{~GeV}/c$ and increases to 85\% at $\pt = 1 \mbox{~GeV}/c$ and above. 
\ask{Add the DCA cut to vertex and the consequence that the L/K decay products do not contribute to the jet energy.}.
The jets have been reconstructed using the anti-$\kT$ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} from the FastJet package~\cite{Cacciari:2011ma,Cacciari:2005hq} with resolution parameters of $R=0.2$, $0.3$ and $0.4$. 
Only the jets where the jet-axis was found within the acceptance window $\abs{\hlab}<0.35$ that is fully overlapping with the acceptances of both charged particle tracks ($\abs{\hlab}<0.9$) and $\Vzero$s ($\abs{\hlab}<0.75$, see section~\ref{sec:V0Reco} for the details) for any of the jet resolution parameters.
The jet transverse momentum is calculated by FastJet using the \pt\ recombination scheme. 

\ask{We need to comment on: a) the jet efficiency for $\pt < 20~\gevc$. Not in the cited paper. Below some text from the jet in \pPb\ paper.}

In general the transverse momentum density of the background originating from the underlying event and/or pile-up (particles not associated to the hard scattering) contributes to the jet energy reported by the jet finder. 
The correction of the jet energy scale accounting for the background energy can be estimated on event-by-event basis using the median of all jet candidate clusters $\ptch$ reconstructed with the $\kt$ algorithm per unit area \cite{Cacciari:2008gn}. 
This method has been used in the analysis of \PbPb\ events \cite{Abelev:2013kqa,Adam:2015ewa}.
In this analysis, an estimate adequate for the more sparse environment of $\pPb$ collisions was employed \cite{Adam:2015hoa}.

\subsection{\lda\ (\alda) and \ks\ reconstruction}
\label{sec:V0Reco}

The reconstruction the \Vzero particles (\ks\, \lda, and \alda) is follows the analysis in \cite{Abelev:2013haa} with the exception of the rapidity selection of the particles and their decay products.

\ask{See how much details is needed - since all follows from \cite{Abelev:2013haa}.}

The \pt\ differential yields of \Vzero particles were extracted via the invariant mass method described in \cite{Abelev:2013haa}. Table \ref{tab:v0cuts} presents the topological cuts applied on the candidate tracks of the decays daughters. The $\Vzero$ particles, $\ks$ and $\lda$ ($\alda$), were identified exploring the characteristics of their weak decay topologies in the channels $\ks\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $\lda(\alda)\to{\rm p}\pi^{-}(\pbar\pi^{-})$, which have branching ratios of $69.2\%$ and $63.9\%$, respectively~\cite{Agashe:2014kda}.
The selection criteria used to define $\Vzero$ candidates are listed in table~\ref{tab:v0cuts} (see \cite{Aamodt:2011zza} for details).
The $\Vzero$ decay-product tracks are selected in the acceptance window $\abs{\hlab}<0.8$, only the candidates reconstructed in $\abs{\hlab}<0.75$ are retained to keep $>50\%$ of acceptance and reconstruction efficiency at plateau around $\hlab=0$ \ask{(is it clear or is it needed?)}.
A five-standard-deviation particle-identification cut was applied on the difference between $\dedx$ in the TPC and that defined by parameterized Bethe-Bloch curve for the $\Vzero$ decay-product tracks.
In addition, by using proper lifetime selection coupled to cosine of pointing angle ($\cos\theta_{\rm pointing}$) selection of $\cos\theta_{\rm pointing}>0.995$, a significant amount of secondary $\lda$ ($\alda$) generated in detector material are removed.
The residual contamination entering the selections was $<1\%$ and was neglected~\cite{Abelev:2013xaa}.
The yield of $\Vzero$ signal is extracted from the invariant mass, $M_{\rm inv}$, distribution of identified $\Vzero$ candidates subtracting the combinatory background from the peak region with the bin counting method.
The background was determined by fitting first order polynomials to sideband regions.
The signal region and sidebands are defined on the basis of the $\pT$-dependent mass resolution as the windows in $\abs{M_{\rm inv}-M_{0}}<6\sigma$ and $6\sigma<\abs{M_{\rm inv}-M_{0}}<12\sigma$, respectively, where $M_{0}$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and width of invariant mass distribution extracted by the Gaussian fit.

\subsection{$\Vzero-$jet matching}
\label{sec:c05V0JetMat}

In this analysis that the selection cuts for primary particle tracks used for the jet reconstruction are not compatible with the \Vzero\ candidate tracks. Only a small fraction (<1\%) of \Vzero\ candidate daughter tracks enter the jet reconstruction. To obtain the yield of \Vzero\ particles within a jet cone the \Vzero\ particles are matched to a hard scattering based on their distance in the pseudo-rapidity and azimuthal angle plane. In general, a particle that is within the radius $R$ from the jet axis is considered as matched to a given jet. In \pPb\ collisions the probability for a particle to match to two jets with $\pt > 10 GeV/c$ is less than $1\%$ (\ask{check number}) and in those cases the higher energy jet is preferred.  \ask{say what fraction} The procedure for extraction of the yield of $\Vzero$ particles associated a jet within a cone $R$ (JC $\Vzero$) can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item the \Vzero\ candidates are selected with the cuts defined within the acceptance of $|\eta|<0.75$;
\item the candidates are associated to the hard scattering with a distance cut in pseudo-rapidity and azimuthal angle plane ($\hlab \times \varphi)$: $\Delta R_{\Vzero-{\rm jet}}<R$, where
\begin{equation}
\Delta R_{\Vzero-{\rm jet}}=\sqrt{(\hlab^{\rm jet} - \hlab^{\Vzero})^{2} - (\varphi^{\rm jet} - \varphi^{\Vzero})^{2}}
\end{equation}
is the distance between the particle candidate and jet axis;
\item for each \pt\ interval of the \Vzero\ candidates matching at least one jet within the radius $R$ an invariant mass distribution \ask{(needs a demo figure?)} is constructed and the combinatorial background interpolated from the yield in side bands around the mass peak region defined by the width and mean of the peak for the inclusive \Vzero\ candidates;
\item finally, the JC yield is corrected for the contribution of particles from the underlying event (UE) (various estimators of \Vzero\ particles of the UE are discussed in subsection \ref{sec:V0UE}).
\end{itemize}

%%\end{center}
%%\end{figure}

%%Figure~\ref{fig:V0FitInvM} shows the comparison of the mean and width of \Vzero\ invariant mass distribution extracted by the Gaussian fit for the inclusive \Vzeros\ candidates and JC \Vzero\ candidates as a function of $\pT$ in data.
%%The mean and width in the $\Vzero$ invariant mass distributions for the inclusive \Vzeros\ and JC \Vzeros\ are compatible within statistical uncertainties.
%%To avoid statistic fluctuations found in high-\pT\ jet selection, the number of JC \Vzeros is extracted using the mean and width obtained in the inclusive $\Vzero$ invariant mass distribution.

%%Given the track selection and the matching procedure the efficiency for finding a \Vzero\ within a jet is a product of single particle \Vzero\ efficiency and jet finding efficiency.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\Vzero\ particles from the underlying event}
\label{sec:V0UE}

In order to extract the \Vzero\ yield in the underlying event (not associated to the hard scatterings tagged by the charged jets considered in this analysis) several estimators have been investigated:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the so-called {\it outside cone} (OC) selection: the \Vzero\ particles that were not matched to any jet considered in the analysis within events containing a jet such that $\Delta R_{\Vzero-{\rm jet}} > R_{\rm cut}$;
  \item the {\it perpendicular cones} (PC) selection: the \Vzero\ particles found at azimuthal angles larger than $R_{\rm cut}$ $\Delta \varphi > R_{\rm cut}$, where $\Delta \varphi= \varphi^{\rm jet} - \varphi^{\Vzero}$  \ask{(say the value)}
  \item the {\it non-jet events } (NJ) selection: the \Vzero particles found in events that do not contain a jet with $\ptjet>5 \gevc$.
\end{itemize}

In practice, a useful quantity for performing the subtraction of the non-jet contribution of the \Vzero\ particles is their density per unit area $\rho^{\Vzero}(\pt)=N^{\Vzero}/A^{\Vzero}(\pt)$, where $A^{\Vzero}$ is the acceptance in pseudo-rapidity and azimuthal angle. Consequently, the number of the UE \Vzero\ particles within a jet can be calculated as $N=\rho^{\Vzero} \Ajet$ for each estimator separately. Note, in this analysis we consider the jet area $\Ajet = \pi R^2$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\Vzero\ reconstruction efficiency}
\label{sec:c05V0EffiMC}

The efficiencies of \Vzero particles were estimated using DPMJET Monte Carlo generator \cite{Roesler:2000he} with the same cuts as in the data except the daughter track PID with ${\rm d}E/{\rm d}x$ in TPC. 
%%Figure~\ref{fig:c05EffiIncV0s} shows the efficiency of the inclusive $\Vzeros$ as a function of $\pT$ in three event multiplicity bins. 
%%For each of the event multiplicity class the efficiency is compared to the efficiency in minimum-bias events and it is found that the efficiency of inclusive $\Vzeros$ is independent on the event multiplicity.

\label{fig:c02EffiIncV0s}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Due to differences in the experimental acceptance for \Vzero\ particles associated to jets (JC) and those extracted through the various estimators of the underlying event (OC, PC, NJ) the efficiencies of \Vzero\ particles were estimated separately for every case. Figure \ref{fig:c02EffiIncV0s} shows the inclusive reconstruction efficiency for $\Vzero$ particles and the efficiency in the events containing a jet for two selections of distance $R$ from the main jet axis. The efficiency within events conaining a jet varies with $R$ and for every selection of $R$ the efficiencies were evaluated separately.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Feed-down subtraction for \lda\ and \alda}

The \pt\ differential yields of \lda\ and \alda\ reconstructed for each selection (JC and UE selections) where corrected for the feed-down from $\Xi$ decays. 
%%The correction was applied before the efficiency corrections. 
The $\Xi$ production in jets (JC) was estimated based on measurements of the multi-strange baryons and their decays at high-\pt\ performed in \pp\ collisions \cite{Abelev:2012jp} and extrapolated to the lower \pt\ using PYTHIA event generator and full detector simulations.

\subsection{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:uncertainties}

\ask{sections below need more quant. and phrasing to be checked; also add a summary figure as a function \pt}

The systematic uncertainties on the particle spectra and their ratios originating from the sources discussed below are added in quadrature.

%%\subsection{Uncertainties in \Vzero\ particle reconstruction}

The main sources in the \Vzero\ particle reconstruction are the level of knowledge of detector materials (resulting in a 4\% uncertainty), track selections (up to 5\%) and the feed-down correction for the \lda\ (5\%), while topological selections contribute 2-4\% depending on transverse momentum. These systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table \ref{tab:v0syst}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%\subsubsection{Uncertainty in UE \Vzero\ estimation}

Two main sources of uncertainties originating from the mis-association of \Vzero particles with UE were considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \Vzero\ particle was found outside the selected jet and classified as UE particle; however, it may have originated by a physical jet outside the fiducial acceptance for jets considered in the analysis and/or originates from a true low-\pt jet, below the considered thresholds;
\item the \Vzero\ particle originates from true high-\pt jet; however, due to the finite detector efficiency the jet has not been reconstructed above the considered \pt\ threshold.
\end{itemize}
The uncertainty on the UE \Vzero density has been estimated using the two variations of the UE estimators: the so-called {\it outside cone} (OC) and the {\it non-jet events} (NJ).
The OC estimator accounts for \Vzero\ particles that were not matched to any jet within the events with at least one jet. The NJ estimator considers the yield of \Vzero\ particles in the events without jets. The OC and the NJ estimators encapsulate the maximum deviation in the yield of UE particles. The difference of the reconstructed \Vzero\ yields in OC and NJ has been included as the additional systematic uncertainties on the yield of particles within the jets (JC).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%\subsubsection{Jet reconstruction and jet selection}

The systematic uncertainty originating from the selection of the jet \pt\ were estimated by repeating the analysis with jet \pt\ varied around the chosen 10 \gevc\ thresholds by 2 \gevc. This variation accounts for jet resolution due to detector effects and the fluctuations of the event background density as reported in \cite{Adam:2015hoa}. %\ask{numbers needed}.
