\begin{abstract}

It has been found that the baryon to meson ratio at intermediate
transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) is up to a factor two larger 
in the systems such as Pb--Pb but also p--Pb collisions than that
in proton--proton collisions.
Particle production at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ is expected to have contributions
from hadronization of the medium as well as from fragmentation of high-momentum partons.
To disentangle the different contributions,
ALICE is studying particle production in reconstructed jets and the underlying event separately.

In this contribution,
we present the $p_{\rm T}$ distributions of reconstructed ${\rm K}_{\rm S}^{0}$
and $\Lambda$ associated with a jet and with the underlying event in p--Pb
collisions at the LHC.
The hard scatterings are selected on an event-by-event basis by
anti-$k_{\rm T}$ jets with resolution parameter $R=0.4$ (or $R=0.2$)
reconstructed from charged particles with a
minimum $p_{\rm T}$ of $10$ (or $20$) GeV/$c$.
We will discuss the resulting baryon-to-meson ratio inside and outside
jets together with the inclusive measurements in several event multiplicity
bins of p--Pb collisions.
