We (re)boot the paper including pp results starting from the version-3.1-internal version/tag of the pPb paper.

# Issues/to do...

## 9th of November 2016

0. At this point this is a shotgun marriage of the results from the two systems - text needs smoothing corners and perhaps re-thinking order of description in some places
1. Review the selection of results (will need text edits)
 - this applies to efficiencies, syst. uncerts., what from what system etc.
2. Improve figures
 - smooth uncertainties
 - unify/check consistency of the labels and styles
3. Verify the pp analysis correspondence
 - MP: I did not worry about potentially small changes in cuts (however, that would be surprising needs to be verified)
