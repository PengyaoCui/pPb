To shed light on the origin of the so-called ``baryon enhancement'' observed in high-energy hadronic collisions the production of \lda\ baryons and \ks\ mesons was measured separately in the hard scattering region and the underlying event in \pPb\ collisions at \sqrtsnn{5.02} and \pp\ collisions at \sqrts{7} at the LHC.
The hard scatterings are selected on an event-by-event basis by jets reconstructed using charged particles with the \akT\ jet finder.
The production of strange particles is reported as a function of their transverse momentum ($\pt$) and the angular distance ($R$) from the jet axis, for jets with $\ptch > 10$~\gevc\ in both systems and $\ptch > 20$~\gevc\ in \pPb\ collisions.

For $R<0.4$ the $(\lda+\alda)/\ks$ ratio associated to jets is found consistent with the expectation of jets fragmenting in vacuum given by \pythia\ event generator.
Moreover, $(\lda+\alda)/\ks$ obtained within jets in \pPb\ collisions is consistent with the ratio measured in \pp\ collisions within uncertainties.
In contrast, in \pPb\ collisions this ratio reaches a plateau at the intermediate \pt\ of $2$--$5$ GeV/$c$ for large $R$, corresponding to the underlying event, at a value consistent with the inclusive production.
